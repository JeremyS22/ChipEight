# ChipEight Emulator

A project dedicated towards learning and implementing a emulator that runs Chip 8 games and apps.  

Chip 8 is a interpreted programming language that was used to write various software/games and ran on several devices since the 1970's. 

The main goal with this emulator is to learn/implement: 
- Cpu and it's instructions 
- Graphics
- Sound

Additional Features I may add: 

- A full GUI
- Customizations to Graphics and Sounds

### Installation, Documentation and Blog Site 
[I also created a blog/docs website for this emulator ](https://jeremys22.github.io/ChipEightDocs/)to track the progress and chronicle some of the lessons I've learned from creating this emulator
