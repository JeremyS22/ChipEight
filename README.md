# ChipEight Emulator

A project dedicated towards learning and implementing a emulator that runs Chip 8 games and apps.  

Chip 8 is a interpreted programming language that was used to write various software/games and ran on several devices since the 1970's. 

The main goal with this emulator is to learn/implement: 
- Cpu and it's instructions 
- Graphics
- Keypad 
- Sound

Additional Features I may add: 

- A full GUI
- Customizations to Graphics and Sounds

### Installation
<a href = "https://jeremys22.github.io/ChipEightDocs/docs/installation"> So far only linux is listed </a>, but more will be added later. 

### Progress 
Note that these games are still a WIP

### Debugger 
Can step through instructions or run debugger in real time without stepping

### Test Roms 
Here's a list of fully working ROMs that assess various components of the Chip 8 emulator (ie. graphics, opcodes, flags, IO, etc.) and ensures each functions correctly
